    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nThis document is intended to highlight features of the Quarto authoring platform, specifically focused on how this platform is uniquely appropriate for Psychometric instruction. Psychometrics is the scientific study of Psychological measurement - it has been described by some practitioners as “applied statistics” and fundamentally requires knowledgeable application of statistical concepts.\nThis brief overview does not cover all pedagogical features, so we encourage reviewers to “point and click” around this document to discover unique elements. For example, external links and alternative document formats are accessible via links in the upper right-hand toolbar. Annotation and note-taking capabilities are facilitated via hypothesis and accessed via floating icons located in the far upper-right of the browser window. Screen reader functionality can be partially appreciated by inspecting images (screen-readers will pick up alternative text descriptions that are provided for each image).",

    "text": "1.1 Code\nThe preferred statistical language represents a common area of frustration for Psychometrics students. This authoring platform offers several features intended to facilitate learning of the underlying language (R).\nThe code represented in Listing 1.1 (and all example pieces of code) can be copied by activating the clipboard option in the upper-right hand corner of the code chunk.\nListing 1.1: Addition within R\n\n\n1 + 1\nFor more complex bits of code, hidden annotations are available (the student can access further assistance by hovering over the circled numbers):\n1library(psych)\n2data(bfi)\n\n3bfi$jibberish &lt;- rowMeans(bfi[1:10], na.rm=TRUE)\nbfi$gobbleyjook &lt;- rowMeans(bfi[11:20], na.rm=TRUE)\n\n\n1\n\nThe psych package contains example data that we can access.\n\n2\n\nThis gives us access to the bfi dataset that contains personality item responses.\n\n3\n\nWe make 2 scale scores, jibberish and gobbleyjook. The $ notation indicates that these scale scores will be appended to the bfi dataframe.\nThe entire code block can also be hidden unless asked-for1. These features permit students of different knowledge and confidence levels to access help on an as-needed basis:\nCode\n1library(psych)\n2data(bfi)\n\n3bfi$jibberish &lt;- rowMeans(bfi[1:10], na.rm=TRUE)\nbfi$gobbleyjook &lt;- rowMeans(bfi[11:20], na.rm=TRUE)\n\n\n\n1\n\nThe psych package contains example data that we can access.\n\n2\n\nThis gives us access to the bfi dataset that contains personality item responses.\n\n3\n\nWe make 2 scale scores, jibberish and gobbleyjook.
