# Analytical Summaries {#sec-summary}

Summaries of your analyses are typically the most important (to external review) aspect of your work. Below you can find a few data summary enhancements that are enabled via literate programming platforms.  

## Data vizualizations

@fig-kitty demonstrates `lightbox` capabilities for images embedded within literate programming reports, whereby "clicking" isolates the image for closer inspection. This is useful for images that contain fine detail, user devices that may not display optimally, drawing focus to specific data features, and increasing accessibility for visually impaired viewers.

![Data visualization through a literate programming lens](data-vis-tips.png){#fig-kitty .lightbox fig-alt="glasses and horizontal bars representing data visualization inspection"}

@fig-plot demonstrates interactive components for graphical representations of data. In presentations, this may be helpful to reinforce scale(s) of measurement, obtain feedback on data clusters, and highlight differences between aggregate and individual datapoints.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Example interactive plot"
#| fig-alt: "An example interactive plot - the scatterpoints provide information upon cursor hover"
#| label: fig-plot
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(plotly)

data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/school_earnings.csv")

## Scatter (men/women) with size conditioned on gap

plot_ly(data, x=~Men, y=~Women, text=~School, type='scatter', mode='markers', color=~Gap, marker=list(size=~Gap, opacity=0.5))

library(psych)
data(bfi)

bfi$jibberish <- rowMeans(bfi[1:10], na.rm=TRUE)
bfi$gobbleyjook <- rowMeans(bfi[11:20], na.rm=TRUE)

#plot_ly(bfi, x = ~jibberish, y = ~gobbleyjook, text = ~age, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', color=~gender, marker = list(size = ~age, opacity = 0.5))

```

## Geo-spatial

@fig-map is another example of interactivity - a map such as this can help reinforce viewer concepts such as *representativeness* within normative samples (e.g., where the data "came from" and who the data represents).

## Browsers vs. Static PDF Readers
Note that all interactive visuals will be captured via static representation if a reader elects to download a PDF file (by accessing the button located within the toolbar). These images are not currently optimized for static representation, so interactivity will render imperfectly within the example PDF.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Example normative representation by geographic location."
#| fig-alt: "A geographic map centered on North America - cursor hover provides city information"
#| label: fig-map
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

## data duplicating norms frequencies (number of people in database)

library(leaflet)
library(maps)  ## us.cities data

data(us.cities)

us.cities$industry <- as.factor(sample(c("public", "private", "retail", "manufacturing"), size=1005, replace=TRUE))
  
pal <- colorFactor(
  palette = 'Spectral',
  domain = us.cities$industry
)

## create leaflet map
norms <- leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron") %>% 
  setView(-98.35, 39.7,
          zoom = 4) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(data=us.cities, lng = ~long, lat = ~lat, weight = 1,
             radius = ~sqrt(pop) * 200, popup = ~name, fillColor=~pal(industry)) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", data=us.cities, pal = pal, values = ~industry, opacity = 1)

#widgetframe::frameWidget(norms)  ## no pdf picture with frameWidget
norms
```

## Multi-media

@fig-pink shows yet another example - videos can be pulled from external sites (like this presentation of using `r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill="#4287f5")` to create and deploy organizational surveys) or can present locally produced video files.
